# User Centric Front End Development Project

#### The project is to deliver a new and engaging front end site for the 3 Circles Gym that allows current and potential members to view details of the gym facilities, what the gym can offer to them and the positives of why they should join as a memeber.
#### The site will encompass all that is on offer for existing members and why they should continue with their membership but also attract and encourage non members who are visiting the site to sign up. This will be done via providing clear information on what members can use at the gym through text and visuals but also from the benefits of an active lifestyle can promote with motivational content. The site will be simple to navigate but provide the opportunity on each page to sign up to encourage the users to do so.

### **User Experience**

The website is for 3 Circles Gym, a relatively new gym who is a small independently run business in Cowdenbeath, Fife who want to ensure they can retain current members in a very competitive industry but to also attract new members. The site that has been created for them will help achieve their goals by being visually appealing, using emotive pictures and icons but will be straight forward to use and intuitive. It will be consistent across the different pages and be simple in design to ensure users can navigate around the site easily. The site will allow visitors to immediately understand what is on offer and how they can join.

#### User Stories

A number of User Stories were documented to help achieve the user experience that has been created.
