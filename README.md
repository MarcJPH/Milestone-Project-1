# User Centric Front End Development Project

#### The project is to deliver a new and engaging front end site for “Gym Name” that allows current and potential members to view details of the gym facilities, what the gym can offer, not only their physical health but their mental health also.
#### The site will encompass all that is on offer for existing members and why they should continue with their membership but also attract and encourage non members who are visiting the site to sign up. This will be done via providing clear information on what members can use at the gym through text and visuals but also from the benefits of an active lifestyle can promote with motivational content.

### **User Experiance**

The website is for Gym TBC, a relatively new gym who is a small independently run business in Cowdenbeath, Fife who want to ensure they can retain current members in a very competitive industry but to also attract new members. The site that has been created for them will help achieve their goals by being visually appealing, using emotive pictures and icons but will be straight forward to use and intuitive. It will be consistent across the different pages and be simple in design to ensure users can navigate around the site easily. The site will allow visitors to immediately understand what is on offer and how they can join.

#### User Stories

A number of User Stories were documented to help achieve the user experience that has been created.

Gym Owner:

1. As the gym owner, I want for visitors to have all the information they are looking for and to make the gym experience they would have at my gym appealing, so that they sign up to join as a member to increase my turnover.
2. As the gym owner, I want to make signing up to become a member as simple as possible, so that users are encouraged to sign up straight away.
3. As the gym owner, I want current members who visit the site to see the benefits of a physical lifestyle and a valued customer, so they retain their membership and continue visiting the gym.

Gym Member:

1. As a gym member, I want to know what type of classes are available and when, so I can join and enjoy a varied exercise regime.
2. As a gym member, I want to know what benefits there are of being a member, so I know that I am valued and should continue my membership.
3. As a gym member, I want to know what personal trainer options there are, so I can decide if that is an option I want to pursue.

Prospective Member:

1. As someone interested in becoming a member, I want to know how much memberships costs, so I can decide if I can afford to join.

#### Features

Existing Features:

- The Join Now button, located at the top and middle of the Index Page (all pages?) allows users to sign up to be a member, by filling out a joiners form.
- A menu option in the top right of the screen allows users to navigate through the site to view the different information located within the site.

Features Left to implement:

- How many users are in the gym currently, which allows users to know how busy the gym is so they can decide if they want to go now or potentially later.
